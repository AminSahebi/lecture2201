# High Performance Computing clusters at INFN-CNAF

An HPC cluster dedicated to CERN studies is available at INFN-CNAF (Bologna, Italy) allowing for MPI applications across multiple nodes.
The cluster presently features a total of about 800 CPU-cores.

## Access
Access to the cluster can be requested by sending an email to abp.computing[AT]cern.ch including the following information:

 - The filled in <a href="https://www.cnaf.infn.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/accesso-cnaf-EN.pdf" target="_blank">form</a>. Please add Daniele Cesini as contact person and "Access to the hpc_acc Cluster to run High Energy Physics simulation codes" as the reason.
 - A copy of identity card or other valid identification document (e.g. passport).

## Usage

 - Users should connect via ssh to **bastion.cnaf.infn.it** and from there access the cluster front-end called **ui-hpc2.cr.cnaf.infn.it**.
 - The LSF system is installed on the cluster to manage job submissions. Jobs should be submitted to the ”hpc-acc” queue.
 - If you have inquiries about running your jobs on this cluster or need technical support, please write an email to <a href="mailto:hpc-support@listsNOSPAMPLEASE.cnaf.infn.it">hpc-support@listsNOSPAMPLEASE.cnaf.infn.it</a>
 - A node called **hpc-201-11-35** is equipped with four V100 **GPUs**, and can be used interactively.

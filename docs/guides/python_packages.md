The worldwide python community has defined clear guidelines for the packaging of python products. 
Very detailed documentation on this aspect can be found at https://packaging.python.org. Following such standards provides numerous advantages, in particular in simplifying the installation process.

## Template for ABP projects

For python packages maintained by ABP, please follow the template available at:

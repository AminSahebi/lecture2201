# Ansys HFSS

## Short description

ANSYS Electronics Desktop (formerly known as HFSS) solves Maxwell's equations in RF / microwave structures with the absence of a particle beam. It can solve problems of four types: Modal, Terminal, Transient, and Eigenmode. An example of a typical task for HFSS is finding electromagnetic modes and their properties in a closed RF cavity (Eigenmode solver). Another example is finding S-parameters of an RF system (S11, S21, etc) at a frequency specified by the user (Modal solver). 

HFSS is often compared to CST Microwave Studio. The two codes use two fundamentally different ways to solve Maxwell's equations, hence an agreement between them usually means reliability of the results.

# NINJA

## Short description

NINJA is a 2.5 D Implicit Particle-In-Cell Monte Carlo Collision code for the simulation of inductively coupled plasmas.
The model includes a self-consistent description of the coupling between the electromagnetic field generated by the radio-frequency antenna and the plasma response, composed of the particlesâ€™ motion and the collisions between them.

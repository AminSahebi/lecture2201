# ABCI

## Short description

ABCI (Azimuthal Beam Cavity Interaction) is a code used for impedance and wakefield calculations created and maintained by Yong Ho Chin (KEK, Japan). It is a time domain solver of electromagnetic fields when a bunched beam goes through an axi-symmetric structure (on or off axis). An arbitrary charge distribution can be defined by the user (default=Gaussian).
